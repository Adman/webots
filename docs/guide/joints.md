# Joints

Webots already disposes of several nodes to model the transmission of power across bodies, such as [HingeJoint](../reference/hingejoint.md),
[Hinge2Joint](../reference/hinge2joint.md), [BallJoint](../reference/balljoint.md) and [SliderJoint](../reference/sliderjoint.md). 
However, in some instances it is necessary to more accurately describe the real behavior by taking into consideration factors like, for 
example, the clearance among gears in a drive train. The [PROTO](../reference/proto.md) provided here extend the existing nodes by allowing 
more accurate modeling.
