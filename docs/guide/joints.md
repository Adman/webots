# Joints

Webots already disposes of several nodes to model the transmission of power across bodies, such as [HingeJoint](hingejoint.md),
[Hinge2Joint](hinge2joint.md), [BallJoint](balljoint.md) and [SliderJoint](slidejoint.md). However, in some instances, more
advanced modeling is required such as the possibility to model the real counterpart more accurately, by taking into consideration
factors like the clearance among gears in a drive train, to mention one. For these situations, the [PROTO](proto.md) provided
here allow a better representation of reality.
